## Get To Know Me
<p>
Ever since I can remember, I've been drawn to structureâ€”the kind that turns chaos into clarity. That instinct fuels my passion for architecting layouts, solving problems, and building structured systems. I'm especially excited by Cloud Technology (AWS) and DevOps, where precision meets creativity. I thrive in organized environments, adapt quickly, and love engaging with communities to learn, share, and grow.
